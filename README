1. PEREC
--------

An object relational mapping from CLOS to RDBMS.

If you want to play with it using PostgreSQL:

$ createdb perec-test
$ createuser -P perec-test

When asked for the password enter 'test123'.

Load the test environment by:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cl-perec-test.postgresql)

Some simple stuff:

(defpclass foo ()
  ((bar :type integer-16)))

(with-transaction
  (make-instance 'foo :bar 1))

(with-transaction
  (select (i)
    (from (i foo))
    (where (= 1 (bar-of i)))))

If just want to load the system without the test environment:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cl-perec)

For PostgreSQL specific configuration see cl-perec-test.postgresql.asd file.
