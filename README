* cl-perec: an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) from CLOS to RDBMS

** Environment for the test suite (using the PostgreSQL backend)

Create the database and user:

$ createdb perec-test
$ createuser -P perec-test

Give "test123" as password.

** Running the tests using the PostgreSQL backend

(asdf:operate 'asdf:test-op :cl-perec-test.postgresql)

or use 'asdf:load-op to merely load it (including the environment setup).

** Some simple examples

(defpclass foo ()
  ((bar :type integer-16)))

(with-transaction
  (make-instance 'foo :bar 1))

(with-transaction
  (select (i)
    (from (i foo))
    (where (= 1 (bar-of i)))))

** Loading the system without the test environment

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cl-perec)

For some details on how to set up the PostgreSQL specific configuration see the cl-perec-test.postgresql.asd file.
