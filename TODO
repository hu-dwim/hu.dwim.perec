use M-x sort-lines to keep the order

-0 subclassing a dimensional class does not make the subclass dimensional if there are no dimensional slots in the subclass
-1 change-class, add-class, remove-class, ensure-class, desure-class (support anonymous persistent classes)
-1 add delayed updates using mark dirty-slots and provide a flush function
-1 revise perec persistent-p/debug-persistent-p 
-2 add asserts in update/select statements for the number of affected rows in store
-2 prefetching 1-1 association does not always work due to not knowing that both ends are persistent (why do we assume broken references there) and thus executing a query upon persistent-p
-3 finish sqlite support (issues: there are no sequences; no reflection on the column level; no date, time, timestamp data type)
-3 what about purge-instance making references broken?
-4 eliminate barely used (by increasing duplicates) system and package dependencies
-4 eliminate superfluous duplicates (which are covered by other systems)
